This is a reboot of [Hs5](https://github.com/adamfoneil/Hs5) using [Hydro](https://usehydro.dev/). The reason is that I've become fed up with the poor experience around frequent socket disconnects in Blazor Server -- at least in the current Azure production hosting arrangement. There just hasn't been a pit of success here. Although Blazor WASM is technically an option that avoids the SignalR dependency, I haven't really liked the dev experience due to the front/backend separation. I think it's too complicated.

A complete re-write of SpayWise will be pretty ambitious, so the vision here is to build a very simple demo that proves we can be productive in Hydro. The challenge is that there's no component suite as such in Hydro -- everything must be done from scratch. This is an opportunity to escape "theme lock-in" imposed by libraries like Radzen (which I've mostly enjoyed using btw).
